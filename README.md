## Why am I doing this?
I wrote my first JavaScript function way back in 2011 when I took **CS 312** at The Univerisity of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. I've been writing Node.js code for about 3 years and if you write Node.js code you will come across features of the language that you don't really know. Usually what I do is watch YouTube videos. So that is how I have learned JavaScript. 

I tried to work through this book as an introduction to JavaScript when I was a PHP Developer. It wasn't very effective. Now I have a lot of experience using JavaScript and I am hoping that working through this book with that understanding of the language will allow me to connect some dots.

## What am I doing?
I am outlining the book with markdown files. For the code challenges at the end of chapter 02 and beyond I will be creating JavaScript files. These will be run using Node.js. On a side note, markdown is the best for documenting and outlining tech. I've documented APIs using markdown based apps like [Docusaurus.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus) 

## Coding the Exercises
For coding these exercises I am not looking at any of the solutions or the hints. I am sometimes refactoring the exercises. Sometimes when I grab a snack after finishing one I come up with a better way to solve it. Feel free to look at Git Commit History to see some of the different approaces I took to solving the exercises in the book.


## Timeframe to Completion
I started working on this book on April 20, 2022. I'm going to try and do about 1 hour a day, sometimes less sometimes more. I'll post the completed date when it's done.
