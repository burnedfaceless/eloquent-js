If you would like to purchase a copy of this book you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3U904BZMAVJ22&keywords=eloquent+javascript&qid=1650466682&sprefix=eloquent+javascript%2Caps%2C87&sr=8-1).

## Why am I doing this?
I wrote my first JavaScript function way back in 2011 when I took **CS 312** at The Univerisity of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. I've been writing Node.js code for about 3 years and if you write Node.js code you will come across features of the language that you don't really know. Usually what I do is watch YouTube videos.

Coding is a lot like learning guitar. You can sit down and learn all the theory but if you don't spend any time playing you can't play. So I've written a lot of software with JavaScript and now is a great time to work through this book and learn the language to the level where I have a mastery understanding of it. I tried to work through this book with very little JavaScript experience and going back through it is night and day. This book works well if you know JavaScript through building projects with it. There are so many parallels between developing as a developer and developing as a musician. We need to force music majors to take intro programming courses as their foreign language because I really think that many of them would become good developers.

## What am I doing?
I am outlining the book with markdown files. For the code challenges at the end of chapter 02 and beyond I will be creating JavaScript files. These will be run using Node.js. On a side note, markdown is the best for documenting and outlining tech. I've documented APIs using markdown based apps like [Docusaurus.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus) 


## Timeframe to Completion
I started working on this book on April 20, 2022. I'm going to try and do about 1 hour a day, sometimes less sometimes more. I'll post the completed date when it's done.
